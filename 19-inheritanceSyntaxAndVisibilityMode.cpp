// 1 - Default Visiblity mode is private
// 2 - Public Visiblity Mode  -> Public Members of the base class becomes Public members of the derived class
// 3 - Private Visiblity Mode  -> Public Members of the base class becomes private members of the derived class
// 4 - Private Members are never inherited
